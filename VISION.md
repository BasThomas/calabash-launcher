# Goals

- Easily run Calabash tests from your Mac with a visual user interface.
- Provide the ability to inspect elements in your app.
- Enable to access your app using the localizations available within.
- Cultivate an inclusive open source community through respectful discussion.

# Scope

- We plan on providing Android support in [version 3.0](https://github.com/xing/calabash-launcher/milestone/3).
- We **do not** plan on adding support to actually write Calabash tests.

## Inspiration

This project is inspired by the open source community and is developed at [XING](https://www.xing.com). It aims to make running Calabash tests on macOS easier and more accessible.
