<!--
Please let us know what version of the Calabash Launcher you are using, so we can better pinpoint and/or solve your issue.

When referencing a dependency manager-related issue (think CocoaPods, Carthage, SwiftPM), please add its configuration file and version to the issue.
It would be helpful to put the contents in a code block too, using ```ruby for CocoaPods and ```swift for SwiftPM.

Also please make sure your title and description describe your problem as clearly as possible. Questions end with a question mark.
